# 🚀 Elevator Robot

## 🧠 What is Elevator Robot?

**Elevator Robot** is an innovations factory run by a team of independent, highly technical engineers and creators. We work at the bleeding edge of **AI**, **machine learning**, and **automation**—and we do it because we love it.

We're not a traditional agency. We're a band of builders with a bias toward action, driven by curiosity and experimentation. Most of our projects begin with a question, not a client.

- **Freelance Engineering**  
  We take on select freelance work with clients who are pushing the envelope. Need a fast-moving AI team? Let’s talk.

- **Incubation Projects**  
  We build tools, platforms, and prototypes that scratch our own itch—or that we believe should exist in the world.

- **Open Source & Community**  
  We contribute to and create open source tooling, and share what we learn as we go.
