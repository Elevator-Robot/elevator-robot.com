# 🚀 Elevator Robot

## 🧠 What is Elevator Robot?

**Elevator Robot** is an innovations factory run by a team of independent, highly technical engineers and creators. We work at the bleeding edge of **AI**, **machine learning**, and **automation**—and we do it because we love it.

We're not a traditional agency. We're a band of builders with a bias toward action, driven by curiosity and experimentation. Most of our projects begin with a question, not a client.
